# Smart Label System - Backend API
 
 ## üìù Overview  
 This project is part of a 7-member team developing a digital price tag system that updates retail prices instantly via a central management system. The backend API serves as the core component that processes price updates, manages product information, and ensures synchronization across all digital displays.
 
 ## ‚ú® Key Features  
 - **Real-time Price Updates**: Centralized system for instant price changes  
 - **High Performance**: Optimized for thousands of concurrent updates  
 - **Secure Access**: JWT authentication with role-based permissions  
 - **Scalable**: Supports growing retail networks  
 
 ## ÔøΩ Architecture 
 **Clean Architecture**:
   Strict separation into Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
 **CQRS Pattern**:
   Writes: Entity Framework Core for maintainability and complex transactions
   Reads: Dapper for high-speed queries and reporting
 **SOLID Principles**:
   Applied throughout the codebase for maintainability
 
 ## Design Patterns
 -**Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access layer
 -**Unit of Work**: Managed database transactions
 -**Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components
 -**Factory Pattern**:  It promotes loose coupling and encapsulation by delegating object instantiation to factory methods
 -**Result Pattern**: standardize API responses
